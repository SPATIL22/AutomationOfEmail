# AutomationOfEmail
Automated the task of sending personalized email to multiple recipients with an attachment.

Problem Statement: 
Your company has organized a conference, where representatives of various companies in Buffalo come together to share their views on work-life balance. 
Now, you want to send a “Thank you Note” and “a Gift Card” to each one of them. But you want each email to be customized in order to make your guests feel special. 
If you do this work manually then It is a quite tedious task which can consume your valuable time and unnecessary efforts.

Solution:
I have developed a code which will take email template and a list of recipients. This code is developed to customize the email template by changing specific words in a template and send it to respected recipient.
See the following email template. Each bold word will get change with the recipient name and recipient company.

Email template: 

“
Subject: Thank you for attending our conference and sharing your views on work life at GHD.

Hi Eric,
 
Hope you are doing well!

It is really nice to meet you at the conference last evening. The thoughts you have shared with audience about the work culture at GHD was really helpful for me. Thank you so much for valuable insights about the company. I am attaching a gift card for you.
